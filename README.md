## Introduction
  - The purpose of this project was to allow students to practice some of the foundational concepts learned so far within the module. There are other extensions that test different skills that we can build on. The project gave way to some customization (a ton of css practice, and html practice) which you can always work on and improve.

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS

## Features
- Clicking on the button allows a random message to boost your spirits or a reminder to care for YOU because YOU are important ðŸ˜Š
- The Choose Your Own Adventure I chose was the "Error handling and clear button". If neither mantra or affirmation is chosen, you will not be able to "receive the message" AND if you wish to clear the current message you have chosen, there is a button that allows you to reset and choose something else!

## Possible Future Extensions
  - Personally, I would like to delete some of the messages that don't apply to me, which would make it feel more personal in my opinion for an end user. Maybe something randomly chosen impacts them in a different way than I intended, so throwing it out, would feel sort of empowering!
